# Welcome!

You've reached my GitHub home page. Here you'll see all my open source work I've done over the years, with more being open sourced all the time!

A brief tour of what's here:

## iOS and Swift

I started my development journey on the iOS platform around the time Apple released their programming language Swift to the world. I hit the ground running with a ton of explorations and libraries.

### Libraries
- [Guitarparty-Cocoa](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/Guitarparty-Cocoa) - A Client library for the guitarparty.com API
- [LicensesKit](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/LicensesKit) - A drop-in way to list third-party library licenses in your app based on a standardized JSON backing dataset.
- [StringBuilder](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/StringBuilder) - A simple port of Java's StringBuilder class in Swift
- [AppCoordinator](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/AppCoordinator) - A protocol-oriented implementation of the [Coordinator](https://mattwyskiel.com/stories/protocol-oriented-app-coordinators-in-swift) pattern in iOS.
- [JuiceUI](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/JuiceUI) - A small collection of SwiftUI wrappers for common UIKit-based views in the iOS SDK
- [GoogleyEyes](https://github.com/GoogleyEyes) - A Swift-native Client library for Google's APIs

### Apps
- [Kingsmen Caf√©](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/kingsmen-cafe) - A mobile ordering experience for a local coffee chain, in partnership with a high school business class
- [BonesDay](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/BonesDay) - An app and widget based on the viral ['Bones Day'](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/style/bones-day-noodle-tiktok-dog.html) TikTok Trend

## Cloud and Multiplatform

As I started my professional career, my personal projects followed my work projects in terms of scope. I focused more on backend and distributed cloud-based systems, and how to integrate that with the devices we use every day.

### Projects
- [mattwyskiel.com](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/mattwyskiel.com) - My personal website, showcasing my skills and ethos with a custom-built beautiful interface
- [Whiskey](https://github.com/whiskey-platform) - A Personal OS that enables meaningful action from point-in-time events.
- [A-List](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/a-list) - A home website for my DJ-style mixes.

### Utilities
#### CLI
- [bootstrap-microservice](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/bootstrap-microservice/tree/main) - A standardized way for me to generate boilerplate for microservices based on SST v1 and v2
#### Github Actions
- [sst-outputs-to-ssm](https://github.com/mattwyskiel/sst-outputs-to-ssm) - Enables sending [SST v2](https://v2.sst.dev/) Outputs to [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), enabling direct use by referencing services in their stacks, and eliminating the use of static environment variables for that purpose.
